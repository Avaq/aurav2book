# Aura Framework v2: The Missing Manual

The [Aura Project](http://auraphp.com/about) centers around a collection of independent PHP packages. Each package is self-contained and has only the things it needs for its core purpose. None of the packages depends on any of the other - you can download and use each of the packages on its own.

The Aura Framework v2 package provides a minimal framework for combined web and command-line projects. For exclusive web projects, there's Aura Web and for command line-only, there's Aura CLI.

*Aura Framework v2: The Missing Manual* is a clean and concise guide to using this powerful and flexible framework.
