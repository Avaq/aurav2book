# Aura Framework v2: The Missing Manual

The [Aura Project](http://auraphp.com/about) centers around a collection of independent PHP packages. Each package is self-contained and has only the things it needs for its core purpose. None of the packages depends on any of the other - you can download and use each of the packages on its own. The [Aura System](http://auraphp.com/framework) is a full-stack framework built around these Aura library packages.

*Aura Framework v2: The Missing Manual* is a clean and concise guide to using this powerful system. You can view it online here or buy it: [Aura Framework v2: The Missing Manual](https://leanpub.com/aurav2).
