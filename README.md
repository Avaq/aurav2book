# Aura Framework v2: The Missing Manual

The [Aura Project](http://auraphp.com/about) centers around 
a collection of independent PHP packages.
Each package is self-contained and has only the things 
it needs for its core purpose.
None of the packages depends on any of the other - 
you can download and use each of the packages on its own.
